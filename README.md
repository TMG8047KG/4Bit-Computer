# 4Bit-Computer
Something that works with zeros and ones

This project is made with [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital), a software for simulating and creating digital circuits based on real-life ones. (I think so)

If something doesn't work add all the components to the Digital `lib` folder after you extract them.
